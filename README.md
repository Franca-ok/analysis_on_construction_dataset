# Analysis_on_construction_dataset
This project focused on analyzing and cleaning a messy construction site dataset containing inconsistent entries, missing values, duplicate records, and improperly formatted dates. The objective was to improve data accuracy, ensure consistency, and prepare the dataset for reliable reporting and decision-making.Using Excel and SQL, I performed data cleaning techniques including duplicate removal, standardization of categorical variables, handling missing values, correcting data types, and restructuring scattered columns. I also conducted a data quality assessment to identify errors in material tracking, labor costs, equipment logs, and project timelines. The final output was a structured, analysis-ready dataset with improved integrity, along with a data quality report highlighting key issues and recommendations for better data collection processes.
The construction company is experiencing inconsistencies in project performance across different cities, with potential cost overruns and inefficient material utilization. There is a need to assess whether estimated costs align with material consumption and project completion status, and to identify geographic patterns contributing to delays and budget inefficiencies
